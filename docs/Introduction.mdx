## Introduction to Synaptic

Synaptic, much like LangChain, is a powerful framework for building agentic workflows using AI as Code. Designed to streamline the development process, Synaptic extends LangChain’s capabilities by offering:

- **Prototype-to-Production Simplicity:** Quickly prototype with LangChain and transition seamlessly to production-ready systems.
- **Protective Stability:** A steady wrapper API that shields your workflows from LangChain’s rapidly evolving ecosystem.
- **Organized Reusability:** Circuits and neurons provide modular, reusable components for building and deploying AI workflows.
- **Integrated UX:** Combine backend workflows with rich, interactive agent interfaces.
- **Future-Ready Design:** Built to support multiple AI frameworks, ensuring long-term flexibility and scalability.
