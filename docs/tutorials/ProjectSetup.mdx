# Project Setup Tutorial

## Installation

To set up the EaC Runtime for Web UX, API, and Synaptic development, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Installation Command:**
   ```bash
   deno run -A -r https://install.fathym.com/deno --template=sink-empty
   ```
   This command installs the entire runtime environment.

## Customizing the Project

After installation, replace placeholders in the project:

- **Organization Name:** Replace all instances of `aaa_bbb_ccc` with your organization name (e.g., `fathym`).
- **Project Name:** Replace all instances of `www_xxx_yyy_zzz` with your project name (e.g., `web-runtime`).
- **Rename Files:** Update the following files to replace `Company` with your organization name (e.g., `Fathym`):
  - `apps/islands/organisms/CompanyThinky.tsx`
  - `src/state/CompanyAPIState.ts`
  - `src/state/CompanyWebState.ts`

You can use a text editor's global search and replace functionality to update these strings quickly.

## Setting Up Environment Variables and Configuration Files

These steps must be completed regardless of whether you run the project in Docker or not:

1. **Create Environment Variable Files:**
   Create two files:

   - `.env`
   - `.env.docker`

   Add the following entry to both files, replacing `xxx` with your desired port (default is 8000):

   ```env
   PORT=xxx
   ```

2. **Update Configuration Files:**

   - Modify `deno.jsonc` to reflect the port specified in the `.env` files, and update any references to port `3000` to match the chosen port.
   - Update the `DOCKERFILE` to replace any references to port `3000` with your chosen port.

## Starting the Development Server

To start your project after installation:

1. **Run in Development Mode:**

   ```bash
   deno task dev
   ```

   This command initializes the development environment.

2. **Run in Production Mode:**

   ```bash
   deno task start
   ```

   Use this command to start the server in production mode.

Once the server starts in either mode, you will receive a URL to visit (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` by default). This will have your site running on port 8000 or the port you configured earlier.

## Setting Up Source Control

We recommend using GitHub or another source control system to manage your project. Follow these steps to initialize a Git repository:

1. **Initialize Git:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit Initial Changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Push to Remote Repository:**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Running in Docker

To deploy your project locally using Docker:

1. **Refresh the Docker Build:**
   ```bash
   deno task refresh:docker
   ```

## Final Steps

After completing these steps, your project should be set up and ready for development. Use `deno task dev` to run the application locally and begin building your project!
