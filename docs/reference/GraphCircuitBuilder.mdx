# GraphCircuitBuilder

Assembles neurons into an arbitrary graph circuit.

## Methods

- `State(state: StateDefinition): this` – attach a state schema.
- `Neuron(builder: NeuronBuilder): this` – register a neuron by its id.
- `Edge(from).To(target, options?)` – connect neurons with optional `EaCGraphCircuitEdge` options.
- `Build(): EaCGraphCircuitDetails` – create the circuit definition.

## Example

```ts
const circuit = new GraphCircuitBuilder()
  .State(state)
  .Neuron(agent)
  .Edge({ id: START } as any).To(agent)
  .Edge(agent).To(END)
  .Build();
```
