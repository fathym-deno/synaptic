# GraphCircuitBuilder

Assembles neurons into an arbitrary graph circuit.

## Methods

- `state(state: StateDefinition): this` – attach a state schema.
- `neuron(builder: NeuronBuilder): this` – register a neuron by its id.
- `edge(from).to(target, options?)` – connect neurons with optional `EaCGraphCircuitEdge` options.
- `build(): EaCGraphCircuitDetails` – create the circuit definition.

## Example

```ts
const circuit = new GraphCircuitBuilder()
  .state(state)
  .neuron(agent)
  .edge({ id: START } as any).to(agent)
  .edge(agent).to(END)
  .build();
```
