# Synaptic Overview

Welcome to Synaptic, a revolutionary bot building framework that goes beyond mere conversation. Our goal is to create bots that don't just talk, but actually do something meaningful.

## Synaptic Runtime

At the heart of Synaptic is the Synaptic Runtime. This is the core engine that contains all of the services that make up a bot. The only core, required service is the Synaptic Bot Service. This service serves as the core interaction point for working with a bot. It manages the conversation, its current state, secret values, and the core connections with Language Learning Models (LLMs).

## Synaptic Bot Service

The Synaptic Bot Service is the central hub of a Synaptic bot. It is responsible for managing the conversation and its current state, storing secret values, and maintaining the core connections with LLMs. This service is essential for the functioning of the bot, as it orchestrates the interaction between the user, the bot, and any connected services.

## Synapses Services

In addition to the Synaptic Bot Service, you can create additional Synapses services. These services can participate in prompting LLMs and processing the return prompts from LLMs into the conversation or commands. This allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility in how your bot interacts with users and performs tasks.

## Solving Bot Building Complexities

Building a bot can be a complex task. There are many moving parts, and managing them all can be a challenge. Synaptic addresses these complexities in several ways:

1. **Modular Design**: By separating the bot's functionality into distinct services, Synaptic allows for a modular design. This makes it easier to manage and update individual parts of the bot without affecting the whole system.

2. **State Management**: The Synaptic Bot Service handles the state of the conversation, ensuring that the bot can accurately track and respond to the user's input.

3. **Integration with LLMs**: Synaptic's core connections with LLMs allow the bot to learn and adapt over time, improving its ability to understand and respond to user commands.

4. **Customizable Synapses Services**: The ability to create additional Synapses services means that you can tailor your bot to your specific needs. Whether you need to integrate with a specific database, automate a particular process, or perform a unique task, Synaptic gives you the tools to do so.

By addressing these complexities, Synaptic makes it easier to build, manage, and improve bots. Whether you're looking to automate customer service, streamline business processes, or create a virtual assistant, Synaptic provides the tools and infrastructure you need to bring your ideas to life.
