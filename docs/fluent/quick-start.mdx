# Fluent Builder Quick Start

The fluent builders provide a type-safe way to construct Synaptic resources, state and circuits directly in TypeScript.

The full stack involves:

1. **Resource builders** – define shared assets like personalities.
2. **State builder** – describe the shape of circuit state.
3. **Neuron builders** – create nodes that perform work.
4. **Circuit builders** – wire neurons together into a runnable graph.

## Minimal runnable example

The snippet below assembles a simple chat circuit and exports an EverythingAsCode fragment that can be executed with Deno.

```ts
import { Annotation, START, END } from "npm:@langchain/langgraph@0.2.56";
import { GraphCircuitBuilder, ChatPromptNeuronBuilder } from "../../src/fluent/circuits/_exports.ts";
import { PersonalityBuilder } from "../../src/fluent/resources/PersonalityBuilder.ts";
import { buildState } from "../../src/fluent/state/StateBuilder.ts";

const pirate = new PersonalityBuilder("pirate", {
  Instructions: ["Answer like a pirate"],
});

const state = buildState((s) =>
  s.Field("messages", {
    reducer: (x: string[], y: string[]) => x.concat(y),
    default: () => [],
  })
);

const agent = new ChatPromptNeuronBuilder("agent", {
  personality: pirate.id,
  newMessages: [["human", "{input}"]],
});

const circuit = new GraphCircuitBuilder()
  .state(state)
  .neuron(agent)
  .edge({ id: START } as any).to(agent)
  .edge(agent).to(END)
  .build();

export const eac = {
  AIs: {
    example: { Personalities: pirate.build() },
  },
  Circuits: {
    "basic-chat": { Details: circuit },
  },
};
```

Run it with:

```bash
deno run -A examples/fluent/basic-chat.ts
```

The fluent builders let you extend this pattern with additional resources, neurons and complex graph topologies.
