# Synaptic Runtimes

Runtime packages built on Synaptic can leverage the new fluent circuit builders.

Get started with the [Fluent Quick Start](../docs/fluent/quick-start.mdx), then
explore the [fluent examples](../examples/fluent/basic-chat.ts) for a
self-contained circuit. To convert existing JSON circuits, follow the
[migration guide](../docs/fluent/migration-guide.mdx).
