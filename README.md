# Synaptic

Welcome to Synaptic, a revolutionary bot building framework that goes beyond
mere conversation. Our goal is to create bots that don't just talk, but actually
do something meaningful.

Just like the human brain, a bot at its simplest can communicate. However, the
true power of the brain lies in the synapses, the connections that link brain
activity with the rest of the body, enabling us to perform a multitude of tasks.
Similarly, by adding additional functionality to our bots, we can connect these
'synapses' to real, tangible work.

Synaptic is designed with this philosophy in mind. It provides a robust and
flexible framework for building bots that can interact, learn, and perform
tasks, just like a human would. With Synaptic, you can create bots that not only
understand and respond to commands, but also carry out complex tasks, automate
processes, and interact with various systems and databases.

The possibilities are endless. Whether you're looking to automate customer
service, streamline business processes, or create a virtual assistant, Synaptic
provides the tools and infrastructure you need to bring your ideas to life.

Join us in redefining what bots can do. Welcome to the future of bot building
with Synaptic.

## Fluent Builder Examples

Synaptic now includes fluent builders for defining circuits directly in
TypeScript. Check out the [migration guide](docs/fluent/migration-guide.mdx) and
the [fluent examples](examples/fluent/basic-chat.ts) to get started.

Runtime packages under `*-synaptic-runtimes` also reference these examples to
encourage adoption.
